# Telegram Contest UI

You can do whatever you want with it, no attribution needed. Ripples are based on this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/TrevorWelch/pen/NwERXE). All SCSS are made by me, icon font was prepared by me as well using icomoon. Icons were designed by Telegram Team.

I tried to do it pixel perfect and I believe that what's inside is 99% pixel perfect. I checked all modern browsers on mac OS and it worked just fine.
